# DigiCom
Introducing “DigiCom”, a technologically advanced browser extension or application designed as a crucial remedy for addressing "dark patterns" on e-commerce websites. DigiCom is poised to play a pivotal role in revolutionizing the digital landscape.

"DigiCom" will provide Pop-Up notifications listing identified dark patterns on an e-commerce site. The implementation includes the use of JavaScript and JSON, with JavaScript logic incorporated to enable dynamic behavior. Dark pattern extraction via ”Web Scraping” utilizes 'BeautifulSoup' and 'requests' libraries of Python to identify desirable dark patterns in a website's HTML and CSS code.

The browser extension uses a dataset of 1818 identified dark patterns to apply advanced machine learning, employing (NLP) and transformer-based models like ‘RoBERTa’ for efficient dark pattern detection. RoBERTa utilizes a Masked Language Modeling Task and ‘task-agnostic’ training for dynamic sentence lengths.

"DigiCom" employs Semi-Supervised technology, a hybrid approach utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data, enhancing cost-effectiveness. It efficiently learns from labeled dark patterns, extending its capability to recognize evolving dark patterns within unlabeled data.

In "DigiCom," we integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL), leveraging its suitability for dynamic environment tasks. Crucially, RL excels in Real-Time decision-making, allowing "DigiCom" to promptly adapt to evolving dark patterns.

In "DigiCom," we utilized the Selenium Python Library to detect default checkbox selections in shopping carts, addressing potential issues such as overcharging and granting access caused by dark patterns.
